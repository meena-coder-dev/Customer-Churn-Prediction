📈 Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer will leave a company based on demographic and usage data. It demonstrates business-relevant machine learning applications using Python.

📊 Project Overview:
- Load and explore customer data from a CSV file
- Preprocess categorical variables and clean data
- Train a Random Forest Classifier to predict churn
- Evaluate the model using accuracy and classification metrics
- Test predictions for new customers

🛠️ Technologies Used:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas and NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

📂 Project Structure:
- dataset.csv: customer data
- churn_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with ML model
- README.md: project documentation

📌 How to Run:
1. Clone the repository
2. Open churn_prediction.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells step by step and test predictions
